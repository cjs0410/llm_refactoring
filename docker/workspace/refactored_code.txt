The refactored code based on the summary of the patch and fixed code would look like:

```java
    /**
     * Returns a new instance with reversed direction.
     *
     * @return a new instance, with reversed direction
     */
    public Line revert() {
        Line reverted = new Line(this);
        reverted.direction = reverted.direction.negate();
        return reverted;
    }
```

In the refactored code, the unnecessary variable assignment to `zero` and subtracting `direction` has been removed. Instead, the `Line` object is directly initialized with `this` and then the `direction` is negated. The resulting `Line` object is returned.
