public Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {
    // defer argument checking...
    this(time, zone, Locale.getDefault());
}
```

The refactored method, which improves memory-efficiency by removing the call to `Locale.getDefault()`, is as follows:

```java
public Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {
    this(time, zone, null);
}
